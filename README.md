# Rain Prediction in Agriculture

This project focuses on developing a rain prediction system for optimizing irrigation scheduling in agriculture.

## Overview

The aim of this project is to forecast rainfall patterns using machine learning techniques. By predicting rain accurately, farmers can adjust their irrigation schedules efficiently, leading to water conservation and improved crop yield.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Directory containing historical weather data.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **models/**: Trained machine learning models.
- **docs/**: Documentation files.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Ritik930/Rain_Prediction_in_Argiculture/tree/main
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd rain-prediction-agriculture
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Explore the Jupyter Notebooks in the `scripts/` directory for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
